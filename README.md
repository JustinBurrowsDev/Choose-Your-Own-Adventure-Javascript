# Challenges I Faced? 

Having to explain the story in a cohesive format using JavaScript is a foggy concept. As well as understanding the different data types that JavaScript can handle and how to properly manipulate those data types.

# How Did I Over Come Those Challenges? 

By doing research on platforms like Google,YouTube, MDN docs, stackoverflow, GitHub, online courses, and reference guides. I was able to figure out the foundation of the logic behind my program. I also was able to get a clear understanding of the different data types in Javascript and in which situations they might be applicable.

# What Did I Learn?
* A basic understanding of most javascript datatypes (numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and functions)
* How to understand the use of operators for equality and assignment as well as control flow.
